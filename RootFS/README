The appliance ships with a 16GB SSD with separate /boot, /, and swap partitions. This layout is perfectly fine
and boots without any changes to the U-Boot environment variables. However, I chose to swap out the SSD for an
HDD formatted with a single ext3 partition. You have the option to boot from the internal disk, USB flash drive
or even from a network share.

To boot from the internal SATA port, your environment should contain something similar to:

> printenv
  ...
  ...
  bootcmd=ide reset; ext2load ide 0:1 0x800000 /boot/uImage; ext2load ide 0:1 0x02100000 /boot/uInitrd
  ...
  ...


To boot from either external USB port, your environment should contain something similar to:

> printenv
  ...
  ...
  bootcmd=usb reset; fatload usb 0:1 0x800000 /boot/uImage; fatload usb 0:1 0x02100000 /boot/uInitrd
  ...
  ...

**ALWAYS MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR ENVIRONMENT BEFORE CHANGING THINGS!
